# Interactive Littlewood Polynomial Fractal Visualizer

A littlewood polynomial is a polynomial where each coefficient is either +1 or -1. Plotting the roots of these polynomials in the complex plane can create fascinating fractal patterns.

This interactive visualizer can be used in-browser here: https://eugene-y.github.io/LittlewoodFractal/
