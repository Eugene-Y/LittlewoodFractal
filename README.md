# Interactive Littlewood Polynomial Fractal Visualizer

Play it here: https://eugene-y.github.io/LittlewoodFractal/
Use +/-, pinch and zoom or mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Drag to navigate through the plane.
In the landscape mode, you can hover over the vertical strip on the right to see subsets of roots.


A littlewood polynomial is a polynomial where each coefficient is either +1 or -1. Plotting the roots of these polynomials in the complex plane can create fascinating fractal patterns.

NB: the project is shamelessly vibe coded, code quality is _below average_
